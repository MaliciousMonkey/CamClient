Cam Client

About Cam Client
================

Cam Client is a pure Java implementation of the Cisco Clean Access Manager API. 
This library is meant to shield developers from having to deal with the HTTP 
interface of the Cisco API and provide a clean interface that integrates easily 
into your Java application. It allows a user to perform many different actions 
on the Clean Access Manager like adding, updating, and removing MAC addresses, 
subnets, and users. For more information on the Clean Access Manager API that 
this library is based on, read the Clean Access Manager Configuration guide for 
your version of Clean Access.

Dependencies
============

Cam Client has no runtime dependencies other than Java. If you are building the 
library from source, JUnit is required to build.

Building Cam Client
===================

To build Cam Client, make sure you have Apache Ant and Ivy installed and 
configured. Once configured, run ant on the build.xml file at the root of the 
project.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What authentication methods does Cam Client support?
----------------------------------------------------

The Cisco documentation lists two possible methods of authentication to the 
Clean Access Manager: session-based and function-based. Currently, Cam Client 
only supports function-based authentication. This means the account credentials 
are given with every request to the Clean Access Manager. Cam Client abstracts 
that work so you only provide the credentials to the library once. I will look 
to support session-based authentication at some point in the future.

I found a bug. What do I do?
----------------------------

If you find a bug or other issue with Cam Client, please file an issue at 
https://github.com/MaliciousMonkey/CamClient/issues

Why aren't all of the operations listed in the CAM configuration guide supported 
in Cam Client?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I wrote this API purely from the knowledge gained from working on a Clean Access 
system while I was in college and from the API documentation provided by Cisco. 
Unfortunately, the documentation that Cisco provides is not entirely clear and 
I do not have the tens of thousands of dollars to buy a Clean Access system. 
Rather than write a buggy API, I only implemented the operations that where the 
most clearly documented. 

If there is an operation that is not yet in the  Cam Client and you would like 
it implemented, please file an issue. When filing, please provide as much 
detail as possible. Data like Clean Access version, parameter values, and 
return data strings are extremely helpful when implementing new operations.
