About Cam Client
===============

Cam Client is a pure Java implementation of the Cisco Clean Access Manager API. 
This library is meant to shield developers from having to deal with the HTTP 
interface of the Cisco API and provide a clean interface that integrates easily 
into your Java application. It allows a user to perform many different actions 
on the Clean Access Manager like adding, updating, and removing MAC addresses, 
subnets, and users. For more information on the Clean Access Manager API that 
this library is based on, go to

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I found a bug. What do I do?

If you find a bug or other issue with CamClient, please file an issue at 
https://github.com/MaliciousMonkey/CamClient/issues

Why aren't all of the operations listed in the CAM configuration guide supported 
in Cam Client?

I wrote this API purely from the knowledge gained from working on a Clean Access 
system while I was in college and from the API documentation provided by Cisco. 
Unfortunately, the documentation that Cisco provides is not entirely clear and 
I do not have the tens of thousands of dollars to buy a Clean Access system. 
Rather than write a buggy API, I only implemented the operations that where the 
most clearly documented. 

If there is an operation that is not yet in the  Cam Client and you would like 
it implemented, please file an issue. When filing, please provide as much 
detail as possible. Data like Clean Access version, parameter values, and 
return data strings are extremely helpful when implementing new operations.
